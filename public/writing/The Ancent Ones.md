Rose growled under her breath. Someone had removed her mark. Again. She peed on the tree, re-marking it for the fifth time this week. She expected some disrespect. This was her first week on the job, but this was her dream job; Captian of the Galaxy Defenders. They saved the galaxy from The Great Old Ones. They were heroes!

Were heroes, was the problem. The original defenders saved the galaxy over a millennium ago. With the threat gone, and creeping budget cuts. The once great Galaxy Defenders were now a dozen people in a rented office. 

A large blue ring on Rose's right paw started to pulse with light. She looked at it for a long moment. The colors pulsing between the dark blue and bright yellow. Her tail wagged with excitement. It was an emergency, a real emergency! This was her chance. She would prove herself and earn the respect her position deserved. She licked the ring. Magic energy poured out of it and engulfed her body. The energy twisted and bent the fabric of reality until she was no longer in the park, but standing in her office. The rush was exciting. Her tail wagged harder, knocking over the knickknacks on the shelf behind her. She turned around, causing her tail to fling papers around the room.

Jax materialized in the middle of the paper tornado. Rose spun to face him, causing her tail to fling more things into the air. The two of them just stared at each other for a moment while the chaos calmed. His hard exoskeleton reflected the harsh office light like a dark rainbow. A delicious looking rainbow, Rose thought.

"Mam," Jax said. His voice monotone. His species had hard inflexible vocal cords. Inflexion and tone were impossible.

"How many humans are left? What is the damping level?" Rose asked trying to keep the excitement out of her voice.

"The news is good mam," Jax said slowly. "Magic damping on earth has reached 90%"

Rose stared at him, waiting for an explanation. She liked Jax, but he often needed very explicit instructions. Rose was determined to break him of that habit.

After another moment, Jax seemed to understand.  "According to projections, 90% damping shouldn't have happened in our lifetime. Now, at this new rate, we expect 100% damping in hundred years"

Rose sat down. "100%? is that even possible?"

"Yes, we believe so. As you know, human technology disrupts the flow of magic instead of utilizing it. Somehow they make everything work with heat and motion. The more they advance, the greater the dampening effect."

"What happens to The Great Old Ones when they reach 100%?" Rose asked.

"We can't know for sure. The records say The Great Old Ones are made from pure magic, making them immortal as long as magic exists." Jax said.

"So if the humans cut off the flow of magic, The Great Old Ones will die." Rose said. Her tail wagged excitedly again. The humans could end this once and for all. That's when Rose decided that she liked humans. They were very good monkeys, yes they were.
